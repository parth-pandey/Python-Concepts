# 2.) Python Variables 🧮

## Overview

Variables are containers used to store data values in Python.
Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning you do not declare the type of a variable—its type is determined when a value is assigned.

---

## Creating Variables

A variable is created automatically when you assign a value:

```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

Variables can **change type** after assignment:

```python
x = 4        # x is an integer
x = "Sally"  # now x is a string
print(x)
```

---

## Variable Casting

You can explicitly set the type of a variable using casting:

```python
x = str(3)   # '3'
y = int(3)   # 3
z = float(3) # 3.0
```

---

## Checking the Type

Use `type()` to find a variable's data type:

```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
```

---

## Strings: Single vs Double Quotes

Strings can be written with either single or double quotes:

```python
name1 = "John"
name2 = 'John'
```

Both are valid and identical.

---

## Case-Sensitivity

Python variable names are **case-sensitive**:

```python
a = 4
A = "Sally"
```

`a` and `A` are two different variables.

---

## Rules for Python Variables

* Must start with a letter or underscore
* Cannot start with a number
* Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
* Case-sensitive
* Cannot use Python keywords as variable names

Examples:

```python
myvar = 1
_myvar = 2
my_var = 3
myVar = 4

2myvar = 5   # invalid
my-var = 6   # invalid
my var = 7   # invalid
```

---

## Multiple Assignment

Assign multiple variables in one line:

```python
x, y, z = "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"
```

Assign the same value to multiple variables:

```python
x = y = z = "Orange"
```

---

## Outputting Variables

Use `print()` to display variables:

```python
x = "Python"
print("I am learning", x)
```

---

## Dynamic Typing

Variables can change type anytime:

```python
x = 10       # int
x = "Ten"    # str
```

---

## Global Keyword

The `global` keyword is used to modify a variable that exists in the **global scope** from within a function.

Without `global`, assigning to a variable inside a function creates a new **local** variable:

```python
x = 10

def change():
    x = 20  # this creates a local variable

change()
print(x)  # still 10
```

Using `global` tells Python you want to use the **global** variable instead of creating a local one:

```python
x = 10

def change():
    global x
    x = 20

change()
print(x)  # now 20
```

### When to Use `global`

* When you need to modify a global variable inside a function.
* When maintaining shared state across functions.

### When *not* to use `global`

* Overuse makes code harder to understand and maintain.
* Prefer returning values or using classes.

---

## Important Confusion Points

* Python does not require type declarations.
* Variable type can change at any time.
* Case-sensitivity often confuses beginners.
* `' '` and `" "` behave the same for strings.
* Casting is useful when converting data.

---

## Summary Cheat Sheet

* Create variable → `x = value`
* Check type → `type(x)`
* Cast → `str()`, `int()`, `float()`
* Case-sensitive names
* Strings can use `' '` or `" "`
* Supports multiple assignment
* Dynamic typing allows type changes
